                                  ----- SECTION 2 AND 3 -----

API = APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE

BASIC EXAMPLE: GOOGLE SEARCH USING DESKTOP
INTERFACE = DESKTOP
PROGRAM = SEARCH
APPLICATION = GOOGLE

COMPLEX EXAMPLE: CREATE ORDERS IN SAP WHEN YOU GET THEM (NO BROWSER)
INTERFACE = SAP
PROGRAM = CREATE ORDER
APPLICATION = SAP

WEB SERVICE
WEB = INTERNET
SERVICE = API
WEB SERVICES ARE API THAT USES INTERNET.
EVERY WEB SERVICES ARE API, BUT NOT ALL API ARE WEB SERVICES.

WEB SERVICES USE:
XML OR JSON TO FORMAT DATA OVER THE INTERNET.
REST, SOAP OR XML/RPC TO TRANSFER THAT DATA.

                                   ----- SECTION 4 -----

HTTP = HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
THE REQUEST AND RESPONSE ARE MADE OF:
1 START LINE
2 HEADERS
3 BLANK LINE
4 BODY

HOW IT WORKS:

START LINE REQUEST: HTTP VERSION(1.1), METHOD (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
START LINE RESPONSE: HTTP VERSION(1.1), STATUS QUO (TELLS IF THE TRANSACTION WORKED)

HEADERS REQUEST: HOST(URL), TOKEN(SECURITY)
HEADERS RESPONSE: COOKIES

BLANK LINE JUST SEPARATES THE HEADERS FROM THE BODY.

BODY REQUEST: USERNAME, PASSWORD
BODY RESPONSE: WHAT WE REQUESTED

*** START LINE ***

START LINE(REQUEST):

GET = READ, POST = CREATE, PUT = UPDATE, DELETE = DELETE
API PROGRAM FOLDER, EXAMPLE: GOOGLE SEARCH THE FOLDER IS /SEARCH
PARAMETERS: YES
FORMAT: METHOD(BLANK SPACE)API PROGRAM FOLDER LOCATION[OPTIONAL] + PARAMETERS[OPTIONAL](BLANK SPACE)HTTP VERSION
EXAMPLE: GET /search?q=tuna HTTP/1.1

START LINE(RESPONSE): STATUS CODE (EXAMPLE: 200 OK)
FORMAT: HTTP VERSION + STATUS CODE
EXAMPLE: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

IDEMPOTENCE (SAFE TO REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN)

GET = YES, POST = NO, PUT = YES, DELETE = YES

*** HEADERS ***
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields
Authorization: Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
Content-Type: Content-Type: application/json
Date: Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT-3

*** BLANK LINE ***
TELLS WHERE THE HEADERS FINISH AND WHERE THE BODY BEGINS.

*** BODY ***
DESCRIBES THE TYPE, EXAMPLES:
application/json
text/xml

*** ADVANCED TOPICS ***

STATELESS
HTTP IS STATELESS BY DEFAULT
HTTP METHODS: REST AND SOAP
REST AND SOAP ARE STATELESS BY DEFAULT BECAUSE THEY USE HTTP.
REST: REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER
SOAP: SIMPLE OBJECT ACCESS PROTOCOL

STATEFUL
FTP: FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

COOKIES ARE USED BY API'S TO REMEMBER THINGS.
COOKIES DON'T USE PASSWORDS, THEY USE TOKENS INSTEAD.

                                   ----- SECTION 5 -----

*** XML ***

XML = EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE
HEADER LINE: Content-Type: application/xml
BODY: XML
XML USES TAGS <> JUST LIKE HTML, EXAMPLE: <BUTTON>click me!</BUTTON>
CREATING A PIZZA ORDER IN XML:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Pizza>
        <size>Small</size>
        <Toppings>
                <Topping>Onions</Topping>
                <Topping>Tomatoes</Topping>
        </Toppings>
</Pizza>

ON XML, IT'S GOING TO CONDENSE ALL THE INFORMATION INSIDE THE PIZZA TAG.

                                ----- SECTION 6 -----

*** JSON ***

JSON = JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION
HEADER LINE: Content-Type: application/json
BODY: JSON
USES "Key" : "Value"
EXAMPLE: "Size" : "Small"
CREATING A PIZZA ORDER IN JSON:

{ "Pizza" : [
        { "Size" : "Small",
          "Toppings" : ["Onions","Mushrooms"]
        },
        { "Size" : "Large",
          "Toppings" : ["Olives","Tomatoes"]
        }
        ]
}

ON JSON, IT'S GOING TO CONDENSE ALL THE INFORMATION INSIDE INITIAL TAGS.

                                ----- SECTION 7 -----

SOAP AND REST ARE WAYS TO FORM HTTP REQUEST AND RESPONSE.

*** SOAP ***
SOAP = SIMPLE OBJECT ACCESS PROTOCOL
IT HAS RULES TO FORM HTTP REQUEST AND RESPONSE
USES A WSDL (WEB SERVICES DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE)

START LINE = POST WSDL HTTP VERSION (THE METHOD IS ALWAYS POST)
HEADERS = Content-Type: text/xml
BLANK LINE
BODY = XML ENVELOPE FORMED USING WSDL

EVERY SOAP API USES POST.
SOAP EXAMPLE UPLOADED TO GITHUB.

                                ----- SECTION 8 -----

*** REST ***

REST = REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER
NO RULES
USED TO COMPLETE A WEB SERVICE (API) USING HTTP

START LINE = ALL METHODS (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
HEADERS = ALL
BLANK LINE
BODY = ANY (JSON, XML, IMAGES, HTML WEB PAGES, ETC)

                                ----- SECTION 9 -----

*** API ACCESS ***

HTTPS: THE "S" STANDS FOR SECURE, WHICH MEANS YOU ARE IN AN ENCRYPTED CHANNEL.

AUTHENTICATION = PROVING YOUR IDENTITY
AUTHORIZATION = LIMITED ACCESS TO RESOURCES

NAME               | AUTHENTICATION  | AUTHORIZATION | EXAMPLES
NO AUTH            | N               | N             | GOOGLE SEARCH PAGE
BASIC AUTH         | Y               | N             | EMAIL ACCOUNT
BEARER TOKEN       | N               | Y             | NOT MANY
OAUTH              | Y               | Y             | WAZE APP
TWO FACTOR (2FA)   | Y               | N             | HIGH SECURITY

*** TYPES OF APPS ***

NATIVE = RUNS ON A OS (WINDOWS, MAC AND LINUX FOR COMPUTER. ANDROID AND IOS FOR MOBILE.)
THE APP MUST BE CODED IN THE SAME OS AS IT IS GOING TO BE USED.
EXAMPLE: ANDROID CALENDAR FOR AN ANDROID OS.

WEB = THE APP RUNS IN THE BROWSER, IT HAS LIMITED API'S THAT IT CAN USE.

HYBRID = IT HAS ASPECTS OF NATIVE AND WEB, THE BROWSER CALL'S DIRECTLY THE API/OS
OR IT USES A MIDDLEWARE BEFORE REACHING THE API/OS.

                        COMPARISON

                | NATIVE        | HYBRID        | WEB
QUALITY         | X             |               |
SPEED           | X             |               |
COST            |               |               | X
GOOGLE PLAY     | X             | X             |
DEVICE ACCESS   | XX            | X             |
